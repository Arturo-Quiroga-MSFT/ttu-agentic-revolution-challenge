## üí° Usage Tips

### Starting a Conversation

Type in the chat box or use quick action buttons:

**Example queries:**
- "Review my calendar and timesheet for November 13-14"
- "What's the total missing billable hours?"
- "Yes, please submit those entries"
- "Can you remind me which entries were missing?"

### Using Quick Actions

1. **Check Missing Time** ‚Äî Automatically analyzes calendar vs timesheet
2. **Calculate Impact** ‚Äî Shows revenue impact of missing time
3. **Submit Entries** ‚Äî Confirms and records suggested entries

### Multi-Turn Conversation

The agent remembers context across messages:

```
You: "Review my timesheet for this week"
Agent: [Analyzes and finds 8 missing hours]

You: "What's the revenue impact?"
Agent: [Calculates $2,000 without re-analyzing]

You: "Yes, submit those entries"
Agent: [Remembers which entries and submits them]
```

### Starting Over

Click **"üîÑ New Conversation"** in the sidebar to:
- Clear chat history

```

**Check the sidebar shows:**

**Click "üìã Run Basic Demo"** or type:
```
"Review my calendar and timesheet for November 13-14, 2025 for alice@ccg.com"

- Provides rationale for each entry
- Asks for confirmation

**Then click "‚úÖ Submit Entries"** or type:
```
"Yes, please submit those entries"

**Return on Investment is massive.**

### 5. Interactive Q&A (30 seconds)

**Take a live question from the audience:**

Examples:
- "Can it handle different billing rates?" ‚Üí Yes, configurable
- "What if calendar is wrong?" ‚Üí Agent provides rationale for human review

## üîß Customization

### Changing the Billable Rate

Edit the metrics in the sidebar (lines 85-87 in `streamlit_app.py`):

```python
st.metric("Missing Hours Recovered", "8.0 hrs/week", "per consultant")
st.metric("Revenue @ $300/hr", "$2,400/week", "per consultant")  # Changed rate
st.metric("Annual Impact (50)", "$3.1M/year", "captured revenue")  # Updated
```

### Adding More Quick Actions

Add new buttons in the Quick Actions section (lines 280-310):

```python
with col4:
    if st.button("üìà Weekly Report", use_container_width=True):
        query = "Generate a weekly summary report for alice@ccg.com"
        # ... rest of button logic
```

### Customizing Colors

Edit the CSS in lines 25-60:

```python
st.markdown("""
<style>
    .main-header {
        color: #YOUR_COLOR;  /* Change header color */
    }
    .metric-card {
        border-left: 4px solid #YOUR_COLOR;  /* Change accent color */
    }
</style>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start

**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'streamlit'`

**Fix:**
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

### Agent Won't Initialize

**Error:** "‚ö†Ô∏è Agent failed to initialize"

**Fix:** Check your `.env` file has valid Azure OpenAI credentials:
```
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-key
```

### Port Already in Use

**Error:** `Address already in use`

**Fix:** Specify a different port:
```bash
streamlit run ccg-demo/streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502
```

### Agent Responses Are Slow

**Expected:** First response may take 3-5 seconds (LLM processing + function calls)

**To speed up:**
- Use `gpt-4o-mini` instead of `gpt-4` (faster, cheaper)
- Pre-run the demo once before the event to warm up

## üé≠ Advanced: Full-Screen Presentation Mode

For a cleaner presentation:

```bash
streamlit run ccg-demo/streamlit_app.py --server.headless true
```

Then in the browser:
1. Press `F11` for full-screen
2. Click the `‚ãÆ` menu (top right) ‚Üí Settings
3. Set **"Wide mode"** ON
4. Set **"Run on save"** OFF (to avoid accidental reloads)

## üìä Metrics Explained

### Missing Hours Recovered: 8.0 hrs/week
- Based on sample data (2 flights √ó 2 hrs + lunch + Q&A + prep)
- Real consultants average 5-10 hrs/week missing

### Revenue Impact: $2,000/week per consultant
- 8 hours √ó $250/hr = $2,000
- Conservative estimate (some firms bill $400+/hr)

### Annual Impact: $2.6M
- $2,000/week √ó 50 consultants √ó 52 weeks = $5.2M
- Assume 50% detection rate ‚Üí $2.6M conservatively
