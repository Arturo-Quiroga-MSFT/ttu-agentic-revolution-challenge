📌 What is it? 
We're hosting a 3-hour Agentic workshop where participants will choose a scenario, then work in teams - competing for prizes - to solve real-world challenges for partners using the full breadth of AI and agents across the Microsoft platform. 
The goal is to accelerate solution development using AI and agents, and to incorporate AI and agentic innovations into those solutions. 
🤔 Why are we doing this? 
With the opportunity for PTSs, PSAs and partners to do more with AI, we want to increase everyone's confidence and proficiency in using AI and agents in partner engagements by getting hands-on! We want to share these learnings with our partners, so they understand the benefits of developing AI-native solutions and offers. We also want to increase cross-team knowledge sharing and collaboration, foster a strong sense of community and have fun hacking. 
📆 When is it? 
We're offering this workshop on three different dates over the coming weeks. Please note - you only need to attend one of the sessions. 
Bonus: If you are located in the NYC, Toronto or Sao Paulo area, you are encouraged to attend the workshop in-person at your local Microsoft office.
