Reminders
 Decide as a team what you can accomplish with the allotted time


 Do not feel obligated to solve ALL the problems or use cases – it
 might make sense to pick one to solve or combine

 Be creative – if there is a critical element of the scenario that is
 missing – please add it so all can be included

Contoso Consulting
Group (CCG) AI
Innovation
Challenge

Make time reporting effortless,
accurate, and intelligent
Contoso Consulting
Group’s Pain Points

 Consultants dislike manual time entry
  — often delayed or incomplete
 Missing travel time and misclassified
  expenses reduce billable accuracy
 Managers spend hours reconciling
  inconsistent reports
 Leadership lacks real-time visibility into
  project utilization
 Compliance issues with client contracts
  due to data errors
Challenge Overview

             Help CCG reimagine the experience of time and expense reporting using Agentic AI principles. Show how AI
             could proactively assist consultants, even if it is only a conceptual or partial prototype




             Remember: Your solution should demonstrate Agentic AI behaviors – reasoning, tool use, and proactive
             assistance




             Choose one focus area (not all):
             1. Context Awareness: Detect missing travel or time entries
             2. Proactive Suggestions: Recommend updates based on schedule or behavior
             3. Conversational Interface: Let consultants log or confirm entries natrually



   You only need to build or mock one of these features
Requirements

Build an Agentic AI Concept Prototype
 Design: Sketch an architecture or flow
  diagram (PowerPoint, whiteboard, or
  draw.io)
 Demonstrate:
   A short script, mock interaction, or working demo
    that shows your AI flow
   You can use a local script, Semantic Kernel/Agent
    Framework sample, or Copilot Studio
 Use Microsoft AI Tools: Include at
  least one (e.g. Azure Open AI, Semantic
  Kernel, Azure Cognitive Services,
  Copilot Studio, etc)
 Present: 3-5 minute walkthrough of
  your concept
Deliverables

 Contoso Coffee & Tea AI Innovation
 Challenge




Reinventing the Café Experience through AI
Contoso Coffee & Tea
Current Concerns

• Sales have stagnated despite a strong
  brand presence.
• Customer engagement and loyalty app
  usage are declining.
• The mobile experience feels generic and
  lacks personalization.
• Younger customers expect smarter,
  more tailored digital interactions.
• Feedback and data are underused,
  offering little insight into customer
  behavior.
Challenge Overview

     Goal: Help Contoso Coffee & Tea transform its café experience using AI-
     driven innovation.


     Scenario: Design a new digital feature for the mobile/web app to boost
     customer engagement, personalization, and convenience, both in-store and
     online.



     Focus Areas: Creativity, Technical Implementation, Real-world Applicability
Requirements

• Prototype: Create a new app or
  feature concept that reimagines how
  customers interact with a coffee or tea
  shop, from ordering to
  personalization.
• AI Integration: Use AI in any creative
  way (i.e. not a chat bot) that
  enhances the customer experience.
• Tech Stack: Completely open
               Feature Description

               • What problem or opportunity does it address?
               • Why is it valuable for customers and the business?

               Technical Implementation

               • Include an architecture diagram and overview of how AI fits
                 into your design.

               Demo
Deliverables   • Create a working prototype or short walkthrough that
                 demonstrates your feature in action.

               Documentation

               • Explain how the AI component works (data used, limitations,
                 and ethics).
               • Describe which agentic tools you used to support your
                 ideation or development process.
