# PowerPoint Slide Content - Updated for Microsoft Agent Framework

## Slide 1: Title & Problem Statement

**Title**: Contoso Consulting Group — Intelligent Time & Expense Assistant

**Subtitle**: Built with Microsoft Agent Framework

**Presenter**: Arturo Quiroga, Cloud Solution Architect - Data & AI, Microsoft

**Challenge Area**: Time & Expense Reporting (Agentic AI)

**Event**: TTU Agentic Revolution Challenge | November 14, 2025

---

### Content Block 1 - The Problem:
- **Consultants lose 10-15% of billable time** due to manual entry errors
- **Travel time frequently unbilled** (flights, drives, working meals)
- **Client meetings missed** in timesheet records
- **Manual reconciliation** wastes 15-20 minutes per week per consultant

### Content Block 2 - Business Impact:
- 💰 **$1,000 per week** in lost revenue per consultant
- ⏱️ **15-20 minutes** wasted on manual reviews
- ⚠️ **Compliance risks** from incomplete records
- 📉 **Client trust issues** from billing inconsistencies

### Content Block 3 - Our Solution:
✅ **Agentic AI** that automatically detects missing billable time  
✅ **Cross-references** calendar events with timesheet entries  
✅ **Reasons about billability** (travel = billable, internal = not)  
✅ **Proactive suggestions** with clear rationale  

### Content Block 4 - Value Delivered:
- 💵 **$2.6M annual revenue** captured for 50-person firm
- ⚡ **99% time savings** (15 min → 5 seconds per review)
- 🎯 **100% compliance** with automated audit trail
- 💡 **$0.01 per review** - negligible AI cost vs recovered revenue

### Architecture Diagram:
*[Insert the Simplified Architecture diagram from Architecture_Diagram.md]*

```
User → ChatAgent (Microsoft Agent Framework) → GPT-4 Reasoning
                     ↓
            Function Tools:
            • Calendar Access
            • Timesheet Access  
            • Smart Suggestions
            • Revenue Impact
                     ↓
            Structured Response → User Confirmation
```

### Key Components:

**🤖 Agent Core**:
- Microsoft Agent Framework (ChatAgent)
- Azure OpenAI GPT-4 for reasoning
- Multi-turn conversation memory (AgentThread)

**🔧 Function Tools** (4 Python functions):
1. `get_calendar_events()` - Retrieves calendar data
2. `get_timesheet_entries()` - Retrieves logged time
3. `suggest_timesheet_entry()` - Proposes missing entries
4. `calculate_revenue_impact()` - Computes business value

**💾 Data Layer**:
- Demo: Sample JSON files
- Production: Microsoft Graph + ERP APIs

**🖥️ User Interface**:
- Interactive Streamlit web UI
- Console demo for technical audiences

---

### Agentic Behaviors Demonstrated:

1. **🧠 Autonomous Reasoning**  
   Identifies gaps between calendar and timesheet without explicit instructions

2. **🔧 Tool Selection**  
   Automatically decides which functions to call and in what order

3. **💡 Proactive Suggestions**  
   Offers solutions before being asked, with clear rationale

4. **📋 Context Awareness**  
   Applies business rules: travel = billable, internal meetings = not

5. **🔄 Multi-turn Memory**  
   Remembers conversation, answers follow-up questions naturally

## Slide 3: Live Demo & Results

**Title**: Live Demo & Business Impact

**Subtitle**: $2.6M Annual Revenue Recovered

---

### Demo Scenario:

**Sample Data**:
- 📅 **7 calendar events** across 2 days (Nov 13-14, 2025)
- ⏱️ **2 timesheet entries** (only 3.5 hours logged)
- ❌ **8 hours missing** (4 events unbilled)

**User Query**:  
*"Review my calendar and suggest missing timesheet entries"*

---

### Agent Response (Live):

**Found 5 Missing Entries (8 hours)**:

1. ✈️ **Flight to Client Site** - 2 hours  
   *Rationale: Travel time is billable to client project*

2. 🍽️ **Working Lunch with Client** - 1 hour  
   *Rationale: Client-facing time during business discussion*

3. 💬 **Client Q&A Session** - 2 hours  
   *Rationale: Direct client engagement and problem-solving*

4. ✈️ **Return Flight** - 2 hours  
   *Rationale: Travel time related to client engagement*

5. 📝 **Pre-workshop Prep** - 1 hour  
   *Rationale: Preparation time for deliverable workshop*

**💰 Weekly Impact**: $2,000 (8 hours × $250/hr)

---

### Follow-up Interaction:

**User**: *"Yes, please submit those entries"*

**Agent**:  
✅ Confirmed all 5 timesheet entries  
✅ Total: 8 hours added to timesheet  
✅ Revenue captured: $2,000  
✅ Ready for manager approval  

*[Agent remembers context - no need to repeat information]*
